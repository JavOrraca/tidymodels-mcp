# Tidymodels MCP Server

ðŸš§ UNDER DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§

Cline's new Model Context Protocol (MCP) Marketplace allows for the distribution of servers that improve Cline's agentic AI workflows.

This repo contains source code for a Tidymodels MCP server that I developed that allows Cline's coding workflows to be context aware of all public repositories and documentation under https://github.com/tidymodels.
